            <h3>Using Customer Admin</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>Using Customer Admin is easy. Just send your customers to the link below.</p>
            <p><div class="well text-center"><strong><a ng-href="{{app_url}}" target="_blank">{{app_url}}</a></strong></div></p>
            <p>If your customer created a username and password during checkout, they can use those credentials to sign in. If not, they can easily get access by providing the email address from their order, which will allow them to access without the need to create a username and password.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Try It Yourself</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>To try Customer Admin yourself, just create a test order using an email address you have access to in the customer details. Then, navigate to the Customer Admin and sign in by email (or using your username and password if you created a login during your test order).</p>
